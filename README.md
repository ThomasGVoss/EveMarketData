The Static Data Export (SDE) is a CCP provided snapshot of static data used in EVE Online. A new version is typically released after every patch which changes the static data, though this may be delayed for various reasons. The files provided in the data folder are only a part of the data export which can be viewed here: [EVE Static Data Export](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources) 


This will somewhat look like this later?
